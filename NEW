SDL::App::FPS:

This file lists only what is new in the last release. For a full version 
history see the CHANGES file.

2003-03-23 v0.19 Tels - 306 tests
  * added config file support via Config::Simple (defaults to reading
    'config/client.cfg'), new parameter "config" to set the config file name
  * support for parsing command line options via GetOpt::Long
  * fixed: $app->option() was broken because it accessed the wrong namespace
  * fixed: switching to fullscreen at new() didn't work since window didn't
           exist yet

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
