SDL::App::FPS:

This file lists only what is new in the last release. For a full version 
history see the CHANGES file.

2003-04-19 v0.20 Tels - 310 tests
  * forgot to include the config files for mandel and opengl - oups.
  * screenshots of OpenGL apps work now (needs SDL_perl v1.20.3)
  * added support for wheel mouse buttons (needs SDL_perl v1.20.3)
  * support for showing FPS (needs Games::OpenGL::Font::2D v0.05)
  * support for console (needs Games::Console v0.02)
  * added the following options:
    - show_fps
    - fps_font
    - console_font
    - debug
    - useconsole
  * reading in of config files describing a font (for fps and console),
    thus the same font-bitmap, with different colors and sizes can be used
  * fixed: option "name" is now known as "title", and really works (sets the
    window title of the application window)
  * when console is open, console receives keypresses instead of the app
  * config reading reads options from default or [app], plus [input] section
  * bind keys from config file (section [input]) to event handlers of the type
    FPS_EVENT, this means you can use in your code:
      $self->add_event_handler ( FPS_EVENT, 'some_event_name_here', ... );
    and it will still work when somebody changes the config file (which even
    your own app could do at runtime!)
  * added: event_bound_to() to find out which keys needs pressing for an event
  * fixed a bug in watch_event( pause => foo ); (didn't work)

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
