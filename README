SDL::App::FPS - base/parent class for frame rate centric SDL applications

This base class can be easy subclassed for your own projects. It is a basic
building block for building SDL applications that need a fast framerate
with event handling before each frame.

Features
========

* Framerate monitoring, so you can adjust the scene complexity in real-time
* Capping the framerate, even with the inaccurate timer delays
* event handling in between frames (very fast response to user action)
* decoupling of the animaition speed from the framerate by using an extra clock
  (meaning the animation has the same speed, independed from the current frame
   rate)
* time warp of the clock (see above): the clock can be warped by a factor,
  which can even be changed on a frame-by-frame basis. This allows effects
  like slow motion or fast forward, complete with ramping (e.g. slowly slowing
  down).

Installation
============

* You need at least SDL for Perl <http://www.sdlperl.org/> and SDL itself from
  <http://www.libsdl.org/>.

* untar/ungzip the package (replace 0.02 with the version you got)

	tar -xzf SDL-App-FPS-0.02.tar.gz

* Check the signature. Download my key from http://bloodgate.com/ or from my
  CPAN directory. Then do in the build directory (where you unwrapped stuff):

	cpansign -v

* if the signature verifies OK, proceed. Otherwise NOTIFY ME IMMIDIATELY. Do
  NOT INSTALL THE PACKAGE! Your system might get compromised.

* Build the make file:

	perl Makefile.PL

* Make the project

	make

* Run the tests:

	make test

* If all tests pass, install as root:

	su
	[enter password]
	make install
	exit

* If some tests fail, please notify me.

Usage
=====

Look at the files in t/ (MyFPS.pm and myfpm.t) for how to use it.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
