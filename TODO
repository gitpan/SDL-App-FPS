SDL::App::FPS:

* stop_time_warp_ramp() is fine, but we also need
  freeze_time_warp_ramp() and unfreeze_time_warp_ramp()
* inline _ramp_time_warp() into update() for more speed?
* add a fullscreen_toggled_handler() hook ?
* code most of the critical stuff in SDL::App::FPS in XS for low-overhead
  (especially necc. for next_frame() and handle_events())
* sort our timers and buttons into active/inactive groups, too, as to not
  need to check the inactive ones at all
* call $event->button() and pass this to the check() routines of Button
  objects, because those saves us multiple calls to get the same value 
* elliptic shapes for Button are not properly yet
* load() and save() are not fully done yet

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
