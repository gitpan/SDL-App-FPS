SDL::App::FPS:

* stop_time_warp_ramp() is fine, but we also need
  freeze_time_warp_ramp() and unfreeze_time_warp_ramp()
* inline _ramp_time_warp() into update() for more speed?
* add a fullscreen_toggled_handler() hook ?
* code most of the critical stuff in SDL::App::FPS in XS for low-overhead
  (especially necc. for next_frame() and handle_events())
* sort our event handlers and timers into active/inactive groups as to not
  need to check the inactive ones at all (this also removes the ugly hack
  that now prevents handlers that are activated by an earlier to handle the
  event current event, too (e.g. when toggling between states by handling
  the same event type with two different handlers)
  + tests for that this works correctly (the event demo app relies on it)
  + same trick for Buttons
* get $event->type(), $event->key_sym() and $event->button() and pass them
  to the check() routines of EventHandler and Button objects, because thos
  saves us multiple calls to get the same value 
* elliptic shapes for Button are not properly yet

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
