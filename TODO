SDL::App::FPS:

* freeze_time() destroys time warp ramping, it should save it and
  unfreeze_time() should restore it
* stop_time_warp_ramp() is fine, but we also need
  freeze_time_warp_ramp() and unfreeze_time_warp_ramp()
* inline _ramp_time_warp() into update() for more speed?
* add a resize_handler() hook ?
* add a fullscreen_toggled_handler() hook ?
* the time per frame currently (on my system) sways wildly from 11 to 47 ms
  when trying to draw at most 60 fps. This probably accounts for the jerky
  movement in the demo application. Not sure if this is a kernel-timer problem
  or something in my code. I guess I need somehow sub-ms delay or at least an
  delay routine that does not suddenly delay for 10 or 20 ms longer than it
  should...(Hm, disabling xmms and any background app still does not help...)

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
