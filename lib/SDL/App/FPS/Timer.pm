=head1 NAME

SDL::App::FPS::Timer - a timer class for SDL::App::FPS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	my $timer = SDL::App::FPS::Timer->new(
		$time_to_first_shot,
		$count,
		$delay_between_shots,
		$randomize,
		$now,
		$callback,
		@arguments_to_callback
	);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides a timer class. It is used by SDL::App::FPS and you need
not to use it directly.

=head1 CALLBACK

Once the timer has expired, the callback code (CODE ref) is called with the
following parameters:

	&{$callback}($self,$timer,$overdue,@arguments);

C<$self> is the app the timer resides in (e.g. the object of type
SDL::App::FPS), C<$timer> is the timer itself, C<$overdue> is the time the
timer is late (e.g. it fires now, but should have fired C<-$overdue> ms ago)
and the additional arguments are whatever was passed when the timer was
created.

=head1 METHODS

=over 2

=item new()

	my $timer = SDL::App::FPS::Timer->new(
		$time_to_first_shot,
		$count,
		$delay_between_shots,
		$randomize,
		$now,
		$callback,
		@arguments_to_callback
	);

Creates a new timer that will first fire at $time_to_first_shot from $now on
(assuming $now is the current time), fire at most of $count times (negative
counts means infinitely often), and between each shot will wait for $delay.
Both initial time and delay are in ms.

The randomize parameter should be smaller than the time and/or delay, it
will be used to randomize the delay times.

If you setup a timer with a delay of 1000 ms and a randomize value of 100, the
earliest time it will fire is 900 ms, and the latest time would be 1100 ms.

=item next_shot()

	$timer->next_shot();

Returns the absolute time when the timer will fire the next time.

=item due()

Check whether the time is due or not. If is ise due (or overdue), it will
fire.

=item id()

Returns the timers unique id.

=item fired()

Returns whether the timer fired or not. Use only after calling C<due()>.

=item count()

Returns the number of 'shots' left. Negative value means the timer will
fire infinitely often.

=item group()

	my $group = $timer->group();

Returns the ref to the group this timer belongs to, or undef.

=item is_active()

        $timer->is_active();

Returns true if the timer is active, or false for inactive. Inactive
timers do not fire.

=item activate()

Set the timer to active. Newly created ones are always active.

=item deactivate()

Set the timer to inactive. Newly created ones are always active.

=back

=head1 BUGS

C<due()> does ignore when the timer should have fire multiple times between
it was started and the time it is checked. E.g. when then timer is due in 100
ms, and should fire 3 times, and then is checked the first time after 1000 ms,
it should imidiately 3 times, each time having a different overdue time.

Currently it fires only once.
